# sibling session can't ship an ungated O(all-conversations) hot path (the
# recurring "CCC is slow" bug class). Fast (~6s); committed so every clone gets
# the same gate. A thin .git/hooks/pre-push shim calls this; hooks are not

# but it leaks into every subprocess this script spawns — including pytest's
# `git init`/`git commit` calls in throwaway tmp_path fixtures (e.g.
# test_ship_graph_second_call_does_no_reparse_or_subprocesses). An inherited
# GIT_DIR overrides directory-based repo discovery, so those fixture git
# commands silently operate on THIS repo's real .git instead of the fresh tmp
# one, producing spurious commit failures only reproducible via `git push`
# (never via a direct `pytest` invocation, which has no such env leak).

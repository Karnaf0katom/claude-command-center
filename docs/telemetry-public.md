# Public telemetry aggregates

CCC publishes live aggregate counts at
[`ccc.amirfish.ai/stats`](https://ccc.amirfish.ai/stats). The page shows the
anonymous open beacon (daily, weekly, monthly, and coarse geo), legacy
opt-in ping activity from before the retirement below, and landing-page
download clicks — without exposing event rows.

## Status: collection live

| | |
| --- | --- |
| App endpoints | `/v1/open` (active); `/v1/ping` (accepted for old clients, no longer sent by current builds — retired 2026-09-28) |
| Landing endpoint | `/v1/download` |
| Public aggregates | `/v1/stats` |
| Worker source SHA at deploy | [`fb1c0e37`](https://github.com/amirfish1/claude-command-center/tree/fb1c0e37/infra/telemetry-worker) |
| D1 migration | `infra/telemetry-worker/migrations/0003-opens-weekly-monthly-geo.sql` adds `first_this_week`, `first_this_month`, `country`, `region` to `opens` |
| Worker deployed | 2026-09-28 (beacon v2: weekly/monthly flags + country/region); 2026-07-15 (download counter); initially 2026-05-22 |
| Collection started | 2026-05-22 |
| Storage | Cloudflare D1 (`ccc-telemetry`), with bounded `pings`, `opens`, and `downloads` tables documented in [`telemetry.md`](telemetry.md) |

The persistence guarantees are in
[`infra/telemetry-worker/index.js`](../infra/telemetry-worker/index.js)
at the pinned SHA above. The download handler never receives the request object,
so it cannot read IP, headers, cookies, or body. Its D1 table has only
`received_at`, `artifact`, and `source` payload columns. The open beacon hashes
IP with a daily-rotating secret and persists only that hash, plus a country
code and region name read from Cloudflare's edge geolocation (`request.cf`) —
never city, postal code, lat/long, ASN, or the raw IP. The legacy opt-in ping
did not persist IP either. Re-check any time:

```bash
git show fb1c0e37:infra/telemetry-worker/index.js | grep -n 'handleDownload\|CF-Connecting-IP'
```

The opt-in daily ping (and its consent banner) is retired as of 2026-09-28;
see [`telemetry.md`](telemetry.md#legacy-the-opt-in-daily-ping). If you opted
in on an older build, that data is preserved read-only under the stats
page's "Opt-in pings" tab. The current build sends only the anonymous open
beacon, which needs no opt-in. The kill switch in
[`telemetry.md`](telemetry.md#kill-switch) still works for it.

## Live aggregate

`GET /v1/stats` returns totals and 30-day daily buckets, and is additive-only
— new fields are added over time, existing ones are never renamed or
removed. As of the migration above it also returns:

- Weekly and monthly active-install counts (`weekly_active_installs`,
  `monthly_active_installs`, `_prev` variants for the last complete
  period, and `_all` variants including the maintainer's own machine),
  derived from the `first_this_week` / `first_this_month` flags each
  beacon computes locally — no identifier involved. The weekly figures are
  bound to the exact ISO week (Monday-Sunday UTC), not a trailing 7-day
  window, so an install active across a week boundary is never counted
  twice.
- `geo_week` — one ISO week of country/region breakdown, counted per
  **install** (only `first_this_week = 1` rows), with any country or
  region under 3 installs folded into `"other"`. `week_start` says which
  Monday the numbers cover.

Legacy opt-in install counts use `COUNT(DISTINCT install_id)` and only cover
activity from before the retirement. Download clicks use simple counts
because no identifier is collected; repeated clicks count again. The
endpoint never returns raw timestamps, request metadata, or individual
event rows.

## When this changes

Any change to what the Worker stores, or to the endpoint URL the
client posts to, is a contract change and lands here first — with a
new deploy SHA pinned in the table above.

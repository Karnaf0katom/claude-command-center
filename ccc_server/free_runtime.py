"""$0 spawn runtime: point one spawned engine at the CCC-managed free router.

The free router (freellmapi, loopback only) is owned by the free-router
subsystem (``ccc_server.free_router``). This module is the spawn-side slice:
given ``runtime: "free"`` on a spawn request, build the env overlay that puts
the child process on $0 models, scrub inherited paid credentials so a session
can never bill the user's plan, and stamp the runtime onto the spawn records
the dashboard reads (registry row, spawn marker, log line).

Contract kept on purpose:
- ``spawn_env(engine, model)`` returns ``{}`` whenever the router cannot
  serve this engine. Callers treat {} as "unavailable" and refuse the spawn:
  a requested $0 run must never silently become a paid one.
- Nothing here writes ``~/.claude/settings.json`` or touches the user's own
  Claude auth. Free routing is per-child env only.

Engines:
- ``claude``: Anthropic endpoint. ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` +
  ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`` (+ ``ANTHROPIC_MODEL`` when a model is known).
- ``opencode``/``aider``: OpenAI-compatible ``/v1`` endpoint —
  ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``/``OPENAI_API_BASE`` + ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` and a
  ``<provider>/<model>`` command-line id.

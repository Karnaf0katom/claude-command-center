"""Recent-session content search across every agent harness.

Powers the sidebar conversation search (/api/search-recall-sessions) and the
Ask tab's recency channel (ccc_server/ask.py). Originally an in-process byte
scan of transcript files modified within the last N days -- itself a
replacement for an even older subprocess-per-keystroke design (see the
MEMO-FIX-15 history in git blame). MEMO-FIX-19 retired that scan in favor of
ccc_server.session_fts, which by then already indexed every harness this
module covered (Claude Code, Codex, Kimi Code, Gemini, Cursor) with real
BM25 + local-embeddings ranking -- running a second from-scratch scan over
the same files was redundant work with strictly worse ranking. This module
is now a thin day-window wrapper: it just clamps `days`/`limit` and hands off
to session_fts.search_sessions_enriched(), keeping the historical result
shape (session_id, cwd, ts_unix, snippet, _source='recall', ...) so callers
(the endpoint handler in server.py, ask.py) don't need to change.

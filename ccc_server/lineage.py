"""Lineage-aware memory (MEMO-FIX-lineage).

CCC already stores three distinct "this session relates to that session"
relations, in three different places:

  - spawn parent/child ("spawned-by"): `session-graph.json` edges, the
    dashboard/worker's live view of `POST /api/sessions/spawn`.
  - report-to ("who does this session report back to"): rebindable route ids
    in `report_routes.py`.
  - continuation ancestor/successor ("Continue in a new session", F2,
    usage-limit auto-resume): the first user turn of the successor's
    transcript names its ancestor as "Origin session id: <sid>", indexed as
    `ship_graph.session_meta.continuation_origin` (see ship_graph.py).

This module composes the three into the two things a "where are we" answer
or a recall/search result actually needs: `chain_summary()` (parent +
latest-successor for one session, for `ccc brief`) and `collapse_chain_hits()`
(fold a ranked hit list's lineage-linked rows into their newest member, for
`ccc recall` / sidebar search).

Every lookup here is either an indexed sqlite query (continuation_origin) or
one small JSON file read (session-graph.json, report-routes.json) -- never a
transcript scan or a subprocess -- so this stays perf-gate-compliant even
called on every brief()/recall(). Stdlib + ship_graph + report_routes only,
no `_core` coupling, so it is independently unit-testable.

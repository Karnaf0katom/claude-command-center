// Telemetry Worker — receives bounded app and landing-page events.
//
// Contract lives in /docs/telemetry.md; this file is the only code path
// that touches the wire. Four rules every handler must honor:
//   1. Never persist a raw source IP (the download handler never reads it).
//   2. Drop unknown fields silently (forward-compat with old clients).
//   3. Reject mistyped or missing-required fields with 400 (never crash).
//   4. Return 204 on success; never echo state back to the caller.
//
// Endpoints:
//   POST /v1/ping  — LEGACY. The opt-in daily ping was retired from the app
//                    on 2026-09-28 (see docs/telemetry.md); this handler
//                    stays so installs on older builds that still send it
//                    don't 404. No new fields are planned for it.
//   POST /v1/open  — anonymous open beacon, fires at most once per UTC day
//                    per running install, not gated on opt-in. Schema v1 is
//                    three fields (schema_version, version, platform); v2
//                    adds two more local booleans (first_this_week,
//                    first_this_month) computed client-side from nothing
//                    but the install's own last-beacon date — still no
//                    install_id, no identity. The Worker additionally
//                    persists coarse edge-computed geo (ISO-2 country +
//                    first-level region name only — never city, postal
//                    code, lat/long, ASN, or the raw IP) read from
//                    request.cf. Rows therefore count install-days.
//   POST /v1/download — empty landing-page click event. The handler receives
//                       no request object and binds three fixed/bounded values.
//   GET  /v1/stats — aggregate counts only; never returns event rows.
//
// Bound resources at deploy time (see ../README.md):
//   env.DB — Cloudflare D1 database with `pings`, `opens`, and `downloads`.
//
// The Worker is intentionally tiny — adding behaviour here is a privacy
// surface change and should be reviewed alongside the public contract.
